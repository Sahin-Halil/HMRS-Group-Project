## Game Overview
LiGHT is a 3D sci-fi/survival game.
The player controls a stranded explorer repairing their crashed ship. Explore an alien world with your only companion being an AI built into your suit.
Slash and dash your way towards the ship to escape the horrors awaiting you.

## Game Objective
* Explore the world to locate scattered ship pieces.
* Stand near lamps to replenish oxygen.
* Avoid or defeat roaming enemies.
* Return collected parts to the Repair Console in the second level.
* Repair the ship to win the game.
* Make narrative choices to determine your fate.

## How to Play
1. Start in the tutorial area.
2. Navigate the area, collect ship pieces, and watch your oxygen bar.
3. Refill oxygen by standing near lamps.
4. Avoid or fight enemies that patrol the area.
5. When you've collected all pieces, return to the ship and interact with it to finish the first level.
6. Navigate tight corridors within the ship's interior while managing your oxygen to configure the ship's terminals.
7. Interact with NPCs along your journey to change your fate.
