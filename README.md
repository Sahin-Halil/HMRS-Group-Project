## Game Overview
LiGHT is a 3D adventure prototype game.

## Game Objective
* Explore the world to locate scattered ship pieces.
* Stand near lamps to replenish oxygen.
* Avoid or defeat roaming enemies.
* Return collected parts to the Repair Console in the hub area.
* Repair the ship to complete the prototype.

(Note: Second environment is locked in this prototype and will be added in the final game)

## How to Play
1. Start in the tutorial area.
2. Navigate the area, collect ship pieces, and watch your oxygen bar.
3. Refill oxygen by standing near lamps.
